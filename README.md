# BMI calculator

In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI

Measurements:

1. Weight(Kgs)
2. Height(m)

BMI = Weight/(Height * Height)

We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is Overweight, Normal or Underweight.

This is the last edit

Thank you!

We have added a new branch
